Recreated a Pokemon game where user clicks anywhere from homescreen to begin the battle. Once the battle begins, it is Player 1's turn to Attack (shown as "Fight" in game) or Swap(shown as "Pokemon" in game). Attack inflicts random amount of damage to the opponent. Swap allows the user to swap Pokemons. After Player 1 completed their turn, Player 2's turn is up, and has the same functionality as Player 1 with Attack and Swap. A fainted Pokemon is indicated when they are unable to attack anymore and when opening the Swap menu, that pokemon button is dulled. The battle continues until either side runs out of Pokemons, and a winner is declared.
